# Domain Utils

This folder contains domain-specific utility functions and helpers.

## Purpose
Provide reusable utility functions that support domain logic but don't belong to specific entities or services.

## Examples
- Domain-specific formatters
- Business calculation helpers
- Domain validation utilities
- Value object constructors

## Guidelines
- Keep utilities pure functions when possible
- Focus on domain-specific helpers
- Avoid framework or infrastructure dependencies
- Make utilities highly testable
