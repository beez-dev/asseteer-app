# Domain Entities

This folder contains the core business entities of the application.

## Purpose
Entities represent the fundamental business objects with unique identities and properties. They encapsulate business rules and validation logic specific to the domain.

## Examples
- User
- Product
- Order
- Asset

## Guidelines
- Define entity classes/interfaces with their properties
- Include entity-level validation logic
- Keep entities framework-agnostic
- Each entity should have a clear identity (typically an ID)
