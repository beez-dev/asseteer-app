# Presentation Layer

This folder contains UI components, pages, and presentation logic for the Next.js application.

## Purpose
- Implement user interface components
- Handle user interactions and navigation
- Format data for display
- Manage client-side state
- Provide responsive and accessible UI

## Subfolders
- **components/**: Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, layouts)
- **controllers/**: Client-side controllers for managing component state and logic
- **entities/**: UI-specific types and models (view models, form schemas)
- **services/**: Client-side services (API clients, state management)
- **use-cases/**: Client-side use cases and business logic
- **repositories/**: Client-side data fetching and caching logic
- **utils/**: UI utilities (formatters, validators, helpers)

## Guidelines
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Separate presentation from business logic
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices and Next.js conventions
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance)
